# DAY 1: BASH
  
  ### Bash information:
    ```
    -Bash stands for Bourne Again.
    -Unix shell to interact with operating system.
    -Bash widely used on linux
    -command line environment for excuting scripting tasks.
    -supports job control, command-line editing, and command history
    -writenn similar 
    
   #### Linux Command and Switches:
        
        ```
        history:
        !<his number> to reference command 
        history | egrep <command> <---------searcheshistory when used command
        ```
        
  **reverse i search in bash ctrl + r  and type char**
        
        
        
   **ctrl + a takes you to beganning of command** 
   
   
   
   ### Getting help man:
   ```
   
   -man bash bash man page
   -man find opens man page for finf command 
   -G end of page
   -g start of man page
   -/pattern search forward for (N-th) matching line
   -&pattern Seach backward for (N-th) matching line
   n or shift+n moves between search results 
   b to go up
   q    Quit man
   
   ```
   
   ### Online resources:
   
      
      
   Additional Links for Research:
    ```
    -https://linux.die.net/man - Online Man Pages. (Search wget as example)
    -https://serverfault.com - Question and Answer site. May help you get command suggestions if you know what youâ€™re trying to do. (Search "linux history"      or "user input" as examples)

   ### Order of Evalution: The order the computer finds a command 
    ```
    1.Redirection <- file need to create file so it happens first
          > output writes to new file
          >> append end of file
          stad in     stad out      stad err
          STDIN       STDOUT         STDERR
          keyboard    monitor        on how code works 
                    |   bof on monitor -------------->
          send STDERR to dev null if dont want to troubleshoot   
          
          
    2.Alias  
    
    alias cat='echo "Nothing to see here"' is example of using alias command unalias to redo it which to find path of command 
        use type tells type of command if alias type -a goes further alias if first the nfunction then binary 
        
        unalias <alias>
        unset <function> <- function
        now the uinset function is a bin 
    
    3.Parameter expansion, comand substitution, arthimetic expansion, and quote removal.
        touch creates file
        touch <file> or touch file file file 
            brace expansion uses {}
            
     **touch file{1..100}**
     **rm file*** <-- globbing**
      rm * removes everything in directory
      
      
    **4.shell function**
    
    5.built -in commands
        built in commmand dont have man pages use help <command>
        
    6.hash tables
        cache 
        
    7.pth variable
        echo $PATH is the  seperated by colon helps speed up computers
        hash command shows cache for command hash table
        sudo rm /bin/<command>
        if run that command it doesnt exist 
        hash -r clears hash table 
        hash = no hash
        
    8.error (eg command not found)
        if this happens command not found 
   
   
    
    
   ### Command chaining operators: <_--- part of number 3 
        ```
        sleep 5 & <-- sleep for five  secrond in the background 
        ; <----
        command;command; runs sequnce if works in session
         ls;cat file STDIO one command STDERR other 
         can use this to get output of multiple command 
         
  &   --Sends process to background (so we can run multiple process parallel) \
  ;   --Run multiple commands in one run, sequentially.\
  \  --To type larger command in multiple lines\
  &&  --Logical AND operator <-- run if first runs properly FIRST HAS TO WORK\
  ||  --Logical OR operator <--- cmd1 || cmd2 || cmd3 cmd2 will only run will cmd1 fails \
  !   --NOT operator\
  |   -- PIPE operator\
  {}  --Command combination operator.\
    [ -f 99.txt ] || { echo " does not exist"; touch 99.txt; }\
  ()  --Precedence operator\



   ### File System and Manipulation:
   
    Absolute   /root is admin / top of file system 
    relative   if cd .. cd //
    pwd shows where your at 
    cd /home cd/home/student $HOME
    cd / root of file system
    cd ~ back to home 
    cd $HOME home directory
    ./ relative file path reference 
    cd byitself takes you home
    cd - toggle between last to locations 
        ```
          - Absolute, Home, and Relative File reference
          
            home dir      ~/ or $HOME
            ab path       /etc/passwd
            relv path     ./ or ..
            
            filesystem cmds
            touch       touch -t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]
            mkdir       mkdir -p
            rm          rm -rf
            rmdir       rmdir -p
            ls          ls
            cd          cd -
            
            links 
            
            sysmbolic link    A shoprtcut or pointer
            hard link     Persistent, cannot cross file systems
            
            
            .<file> hidden file
            ls -a to look at hidden files
              
          ```
        curl equilivant of cat 
          
          
**curl cht.sh/grep** <--- better man page for grep can be used on any command SHOW EXAMPLES

**explianshell.com** explains the command   



 ###  Processes and Memory:
    Process Hierarchy
      kernel
        Init - 01
            BASH
               ps 
          process snapshot
            - ps -elf 
          terminating:
              -kill    kill -9 1234
              -killall  killall firefox 
              
              
              
  ### Cat More || Less
        cat(1) - conatenate files and print on the standard outut" -n line numbers
            head top 10 lines by default 
            tail last 10 lines default
            less parse easier 
            more 
               
        
   ### Finding Files and Dirs:
   
      Find(1) - search for files in a directory hierarchy" does recrusion by default
      -locate     looks for certain file */<file>*
      -whereis    like which but man page
      -which      file path
      -find       
      whatis      summary of what command does
      what do we use find for?
          Does it parse through the content or just files 
          Is it limited to just fikenames or what can it search by?
          
          
                find -iname ".conf" denotes case- insensitive file anything ending .conf
        
            find [LOCATION] [OPTIONS]
                  find /etc -iname "*.conf" 2>/dev/null
                  find /etc -iname "*.conf"  > /dev/null <-- displays errors to screen
                  
                 find -maxdepth <dirs deep> only a certain dic deep
                 file -type   f     only displays files
                 find -mtime 2    modified 2 days ago
                 
  **-mmim**               <-- find out difference of mmim and mtime 
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                 
   #### exec option:
    
                 
                 
                
                 -exec based on what it founf execute aginst eahc item in my output
                 
                 
                 ls -l PATH/TO/DIRECTORY grep[OPTIONS]"pattern" {} ls {} grep pattern {}
                 
                 
                 
   # DAY 1 challenges:
   
  ## q1.Activity: Using Brace-Expansion, create the following directories within the $HOME directory:

    1123
    1134
    1145
    1156

      **mkdir $HOME/{1123,1134,1145,1156}** <--- create 4 directories using brace expansion within home directory
   or   mkdir $HOME/11{23,34,45,56}   
         Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated, for commands that will take multiple arguements. For the below examples, the first example is equivalent to the second command. 
         
         brace expansion uses {}
      
      
  ## q2.Use Brace-Expansion to create the following files within the $HOME/1123 directory. You may need to create the $HOME/1123 directory. Make the following files, but utilze Brace Expansion to make all nine files with one touch command.

Files to create:

    1.txt
    2.txt
    3.txt
    4.txt
    5.txt
    6~.txt
    7~.txt
    8~.txt
    9~.txt

  
      touch $HOME/1123/{{1..5},{6~,7~,8~,9~}}.txt
                        or
      touch $HOME/1123/{1..5}.txt $HOME/1123/{6..9}~.txt <------ can uses multiple arguements with spaces note the ~.txt as a good way to get it done.
      
      we leanred can use brace expnasion to crate files a nd directories 
      
      
  ## q3.Using the find command, list all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt.
  
  
  
      find $HOME/1123 -type f -name "*.txt"   <------ encrouages to uses double quotes to prevent uninteded results 
      find /PATH/LOCATION/ [BOOLEAN] [OPTIONS]
      find $HOME/1123 -iname "*.txt" <-- case insensitive 
      find $HOME/1123/*.txt <-- shortesst form
      
  ## q4.List all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt. Omit the files containing a tilde (~) character.
  
  
  
      find $HOME/1123 -type f -name "*.txt" | grep -v "~" <--- Omit means not show so all txt fils without ~  
      find $HOME/1123 -iname "*.txt" | egrep -v "~"      <---- egrep grep -v meansnot usually ends with filename butsince | can uses jus t~
      find $HOME/1123 -iname "*.txt" ! -iname "*~*"       <---- the booleans operator left of the options only effects option inforn of it 
      find $HOME/1123 -iname "*[^~].txt"                  <----- regex way not tiddla
      find $HOME/1123 -type f \(-iname "*.txt" ! -iname "*~*" \) <-- more regex
      find $HOME/1123 -type f -iname '[0-9].txt'          <--- more regex 
      find $HOME/1123/*.txt ! -iname "*~*"
      | passes the output of one command and passes it into the net command 
      
      
  ## q5.Copy all files in the $HOME/1123 directory, that end in ".txt", and omit files containing a tilde "~" character, to directory $HOME/CUT.
  
  
      cp --copy-content $HOME/1123/{1..9}.txt $HOME/CUT        **or**         find $HOME/1123/?.txt -type f -exec cp "{}" $HOME/CUT \;
          
          use middle mouse button on terminal to copy and paste 
          find LOCATION OPTIONS -exec COMMAND {}
          **find $HOME/1123 -iname "*[^~].txt" -exec cp {} $HOME.CUT \;**
              cp $HOME/1123/*[^~].txt $HOME/CUT
          
          grep pattern filename  <------- thought process
          -exec grep pattern {} \; <----exec is kinda like pipe grabs output of first command and executes it it second command the src file for cp to CUT
          cp scr_file dst_file
          -exec cp {} $HOME/CUT \;
          haf to create $HOME/CUT
      
      
  ## q6.Using ONLY the find command, find all empty files/directories in directory /var and print out ONLY the filename (not absolute path), and the inode number, separated by newlines.
  
  Example Output

123 file1 \
456 file2 \
789 file3 \
  
      **find /var/ -empty -type f,d -printf '%i %f\n'**    <---return all empty files in /var using prescribed formate(inode filename\n) no absolute path"
      
      
     Process:
     
      difference between zero size file and empty file 
      find /var 
      find /var 2>/dev/null
      find /var 2>/dev/null | head 
      find /var 
      man find | egrep "empty" or man find | egrep "^\s+\-(type|name|exec)\s" 
      egrep = grep -E 
      egrep -B1  "root|student" /etc/passwd
      curl cht.sh/find | egrep "printf"
      find /var -empty -printf '%f\n' 2>/dev/null | head
      man find | egrep "indoe"
      find /var -empty -printf 'Inode: %i  File: %f\n' 2>/dev/null | head
      
      
      
  ## q7.Using ONLY the find command, find all files on the system with inode 4026532575 and print only the filename to the screen, not the absolute path to the file, separating each filename with a newline. Ensure unneeded output is not visible.
  
      find . -type f printf '%f\n' -inum 4026532575 2>/dev/null
      
      find / -inum 999 -printf '%f\n' 2>/dev/null | head 
      
      this chanllege find all files across system for spefic inode prit filename with newline used man find | egrep inode number 
      use hitsory to see step by step proecess of execution
      
      
      
  ## q8. Using only the ls -l and cut Commands, write a BASH script that shows all filenames with extensions ie: 1.txt, etc., but no directories, in $HOME/CUT. Write those to a text file called names in $HOME/CUT directory. Omit the names filename from your output.
  
  
  
 ls -l $HOME/CUT | cut  -d. -f1- -s | cut -d: -f2| cut -d' ' -f2 > $HOME/CUT/names
    
    cut on open space last item .txt extensions or only extensions 
    -s suppress anyhting hwat dosnt match demands 
    -d is delimter can be anything 
    -f is fields can be range to infinity 
    
    
    
    
  # DAY 2: 
 ## Overview
    Condiontionals
    Command Substitution
    Commands
 
 ## Conditionals 
  Logical operators used in bash condiotional expressions 
    -e file exist
    -ffile exist and is a regular file
    -d file exist and is a directory
    == strings, is equal to strings
    -eq numbers, is equal to
    != strings, is NOT equal to
    
  The if condiotional expression helps automate the decision-making process during a program
  
  if [[condition]]; then
     command 
  elif [[ condition ]]; then
     command
  else 
     command
  fi 
  
  
  when to use (== vs.-eq) &(!= vs -ne)"
      if its letters use symbols ie == or !=
      if its numbers use letters ie -eq -ne
    
    
    
    
 ## Command Substitution
 
 
 echo todays is $(date)
 PROC =$(ps-elf)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Commands
 **alias**
 ```
    alias
        -view all alias
    alaias vim ='nano'
        -creates alias vim for nano
    unalias vim
        -unalias vim so it no longer resolves as nano
    alias egrep='egrep -- color=auto'
        -best use of aliases to include common options of cmds
    \egrep  
        negate the alias to run egrep without 
        --color=auto option
     Rules/limits 
        -Aliases are NOT persistent by default.
        -Alias names CANNOT use / $ '' = or any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters
    
   ``` 
    
    
    
    
 **sort**
 ```
 sort(1) - sort lines of text files 
    sort
       - sort content according to position on ASCII table
    sort -n
       -sorts content numerically
     sort -u
        -sort content uniquely
     sort -mn
         -sort content numerically reversed
     sort -t'+'
        -specify field seperator '+'
  ```  
 **uniq**
   ```
   uniq(1)-report or omit repeated lines
      
      uniq
         -select content uniquely, MUST ALREADY BE SORTED 
      uniq -c
         -select content uniquely with a count reading 
      uniq -u
          -Display only the unique lines (lines wihtout duplicates)
      uniq -d
          -Display only the duplicate lines (opposite of -u)
    
   ```
    
 **awk**
  ```
     awk(1) - pattern scanning and process language
          
          Syntax:
              awk [options] 'selection_criteria {action }' input-file > output-file 
                    awk -f: '{print $1}'
                          -displays 1st field delimited by a ":"
                    awk '{print $2}'
                          -displays 2nd field; delimited automatically by wite space.
                     awk -f: '($3 == 0) {print $1}' /etc/passwd
                          - collon on filed sepertor if third field equals zero print field 1 aka username 
   ```
  **sed**
  
  ```
      sed(1) - stream editor for filtering and transforming text"
          
            sed 's/abc/123/'
                -Replace FIRST  occurrence of abc in every line with 123
            sed 's/abc/123/g'
                -Replace EVERY occurrence of abc in every line with 123
            sed '/sus/d'
                -Delete the sus lines. Output everything else.
            sed -i '<expression>' file.txt
                 -"sed inplace" to make changes permament in file.txt
        
        IS NOT PERMAMENT UNLESS OUTUT TO A FILE 
        
        used for substituion can used anything / + usuall if substituion has slashes sed s/<pattern>/<change>/g' substitutes gloablly pattern wiht change           slash seperators can be different.
        
        egrep "student" /etc/passwd | sed 's/student/Longo/g;s@1001@1775@g' <-- multiple arguments 
        Longo:x:1775:1775::/home/Longo:/bin/bash
        
        can be used for deletion sed'/PATTERN/d'
        
        egrep "student|root" /etc/passwd 
        root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
        student:x:1001:1001::/home/student:/bin/bash
        
        student@lin-ops:~$ egrep "student|root" /etc/passwd | sed '/root/d'
        student:x:1001:1001::/home/student:/bin/bash

  ### Activities 6-10
  
  
 ##### q6.Write a basic bash script that greps ONLY the IP addresses in the text file provided (named StoryHiddenIPs in the current directory); sort them             uniquely by number of times they appear. HIGH TO LOW 
      
      egrep -o "(\b25[0-5]|\b2[0-4][0-9]|\b[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)(\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}" StoryHiddenIPs | sort | uniq -c | sort -r
      
      egrep -o only return match not whole line given IP sort them count them and reverse order 
          still confused on how to sort and use uniq 
       Regex.
           egrep "([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" <file>
          
          
 ##### q7.Using ONLY the awk command, write a BASH one-liner script that extracts ONLY the names of all the system and user accounts that are not UIDs 0-3.Only display those that use /bin/bash as their default shell.The input file is named $HOME/passwd and is located in the current directory. Output the results to a file called $HOME/SED/names.txt
      
      awk -F: '($NF=="/bin/bash" && $3>3) {print $1}' $HOME/passwd > $HOME/SED/names.txt
        
        awk natrually serpates by a vraibel amount of space 
        
 ##### q8.Find all dmesg kernel messages that contain CPU or BIOS (uppercase) in the string, but not usable or reserved (case-insensitive)Print only the msg itself, omitting the bracketed numerical expressions ie: [1.132775]
  
  dmesg | egrep 'BIOS|CPU' | egrep -vi 'usable|reserved' | cut -d']' -f2-
          -i means case insensitive
          -v means get rid of lines what match 
      
      
 ##### q9. Write a Bash script using "Command Substitution" to replace all passwords, using openssl, from the file $HOME/PASS/shadow.txt with the MD5 encrypted password: Password1234, with salt: bad4u Output of this command should go to the screen/standard output. You are not limited to a particular command, however you must use openssl. Type man openssl passwd for more information.
 
    OPEN=$(openssl passwd -1 -salt bad4u Password1234)

     awk -F: -v "vv=$OPEN" '{OFS=":"}{$2=vv; print$0}' $HOME/PASS/shadow.txt  <---- perfect example of variable substitution REPLACES Passwords
      second part of etc shadow 
      sudo cat /etc/shadow 

    command substitution 
      openssl <file> <hash> <salt <password> <---- syntax
      OFS retains colon seperator 
      using set can use spaces replace with colon
 
 
##### q10.Using ONLY sed, write all lines from $HOME/passwd into $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt that do not end with either /bin/sh or /bin/false.

      sed '/\/bin\/false/d' '/\/bin\/sh/d' $HOME/passwd > $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt <--- can also use semi colons to pass multiple arguements 
             /d deletes and sends to file half to backslash bin/fasle and /bin/sh 

# Day 3:


## BASH Parameters (Variables):


      Parameter vs Variable:

      -In a bash context, a parameter is an entity that stores values.
      -Furthermore, a parameter can be a 
            name (varaible)
            number (positionbal parameter)
            special character (special parameter)
      -Therefore a variable is a parater denoted by a name 
            like man bash
            
 ##### BASH PARAMETERS (VARIABLES)
        
        Variables are parameters set with a name (identiier) on the left of an equal sign and a value (or nothing) on the right side.
        Variables are user defined.
        
     ** NOTE: There CANNOT be any spaces any spaces on either side of teh equal sign **
     
     **Special Parameters:**
          $#  = This parameter repersents the number of arguements passed to the shell script
          $0  = This parameter repersents the scrpt nmae
          $i  = this parameter repersents the ith argument passed to the shell script like s1,s2
          s*  = This parameter gives all arguements passed to the shell script seperated by space.
          $!  = This parameter gives PID of the last background running process
     *    $?  = parameter repersents how command was run 0 good it work 1 error it didnt work
     *    $$  = parameter repersents process id of current shell 
     *    $-  = parameter repersents current flag repersented in shell bash bourne etc 
          $@  = This parameter holds all arugemts apssed to the script and reat them as an array It is similar to the $* parameter
          
## Functions:
      Functions:
          -Allow breaking of code into more manageable blocks
          -series of command executed as if a single command
          -Can contain varaibles, loops, accept parameters, and return a value 
          -declare functions first, thne call it 
          -there are few different formats/styles for laying out a function
          -DEMO: function.sh
                 #!/bin/bash
  ```
  2 #function decalration thingy section
  3 function focus() {
  4  echo '"Your focus dtermines your reality." -Qui-Gon Jin'
  5 
  6 
  7 
  8 
  9 }
 10 
 11 hello() {
 12     echo '"hello" -Obi Wan Kenobi'
 13 
 14 }
 15 #invoke that function yo
 16 #focus
 17 
 18 
 19 function odd() {
 20     echo '"Never tell me the odds." -Han Solo'
 21 
 22 
 23 }
 24 hello
 25 odd
 26 
```
## Variable Substituion:
      -Ultimately, its just replacing a variable with its value.
      
 ```  
  1 #!/bin/bash
  2 
  3 sub1() {
  4     #simple variable substituion
  5     name="John"
  6     echo $name
  7 }
  8 
  9 sub2() {
 10     #variable subsitution within double quotes
 11     name="John"
 12     echo "My name isnt $name"
 13 }
 14 sub3() {
 15     #variable subsittution with single quotes
 16     name="zach"
 17     echo 'Your name is $name'
 18 }
 19 sub4() {
 20     #using curly braces t oseperate variable surroudning text
 21     name="john"
 22     echo "My name is $namenny5"
 23     echo "My name is ${name}nny5"
 24 }
 25 #invoke functions 
 26 #sub1
 27 #sub2
 28 #sub3
 29 #sub4
 30 
 31 sub5() {
 32     #use curly braces to substitute the value of a variable insdie parameter expansio    n
 33     name="John"
 34     echo ${name:0:2}
 35 }
 36 

```


                                                                               
### Activities 11-15:


##### q11.  Using find, find all files under the $HOME directory with a .bin extension ONLY.Once the file(s) and their path(s) have been found, remove the file Ensure there is no trailing / at the end of the directory path when outputting to standard output.You may need to sort the output depending on the command(s) you use. Have each path displayed only once.

     --- find $HOME -type f  -iname "*.bin" -printf '%h\n' 2>/dev/null | sort | uniq <---- can also use sort -u to sort uniquely 
      man find | egrep "^\s+%" | egrep name <---- how to search for help within man pages can use egrep 
     --- find / -iname "*.bin" 2>/dev/null | tail | rev | cut -d/ -f22 | rev <--- dont know how rev works 
     --- find $HOME -iname "*.bin" 2>/dev/ull | tail | awk 'BEGIN{FS="/";OPS="/"}{NF=NF-1;print $0}' <--- wtf so begin block define parameters for field seperator and how to return the field seperator (OPS) is seperate from the actual code block ither middle or end dont know how it gets rid of duplicates clever way to define last part -1 and print whole thing
     --- find $HOME -iname "*.bin" 2>/dev/ull | tail | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="/"}{NF--print}'
      could do -F<seperator> 
      
##### q12.Write a script that will do the following.

    Write a script which will copy the last entry/line in the passwd-like file specified by the $1 positional parameter
    Modify the copied line to change:
        User name to the value specified by $2 positional parameter
        Used id and group id to the value specified by $3 positional parameter
        Home directory to a directory matching the user name specified by $2 positional parameter under the /home directory (i.e. if the $2 was 'Chris', the new line would have /home/Chris as its home directory)
        The default shell to `/bin/bash'
     Append the modified line to the end of the file
        
        function $1 $2 $3   
      File=$1
      User=$2
      id=$3
      lastline=$(tail -n1 $File)
      dir="/home/$user"
      shelly='/bin/bash'
      echo "$lastline" | awk -F: -v vv=User -v ii=$id -v dd=$dir -v ss=$shelly '{OFS=":"}{$1=vv;;$3=$4=ii,$6=dd;$NF=ss;print}'


        tail -1 $1 | awk -F: -v vv=$2 -v ss=$3 '{OFS=":"}{$1=vv; $4=ss; $3=ss; $NF="/bin/bash"; $6="/home/"vv; print $0}' >> $1


##### q13.
    Find all executable files under the following four directories:
        /bin
        /sbin
        /usr/bin
        /usr/sbin
    Sort the filenames with absolute path, and get the md5sum of the 10th file from the top of the list.
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -name passwd | md5sum
9231fb35b4431d59eae53a8c0d673231  -
[chris@localhost ~]$ md5sum /etc/passwd
62f5fa5100adcee3305cf979b5734a3e  /etc/passwd

 
 -wants second method
 
 PASS=$(find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin -type f -executable | sort | head | tail -1) 
 md5sum $PASS | awk '{print $1}' 
 
        head | tail -1 
        awk 'NR==10{print}'
        sed -n 10p

##### q14.Using any BASH command complete the following:

    Sort the /etc/passwd file numerically by the GID field.
    For the 10th entry in the sorted passwd file, get an md5 hash of that entryâ€™s home directory.
    Output ONLY the MD5 hash of the directory's name to standard output.

        sort -k4 -n -t":" /etc/passwd | head | tail -1 | awk -F: '{print $6}' | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'
        sort it by the fourth column numerically based on colon serperators on file /etc/passwd  | get the 10th one 
        print the 6th field home directory md5sum it and print only the md5sum 
        can use 'NR==10{print}' to print the tenth line can use cut -d' ' -f1 to get the first field.
        
##### q15.

    Write a script which will find and hash the contents 3 levels deep from each of these directories: /bin /etc /var
    Your script should:
        Exclude file type named pipes. These can break your script.
        Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to separate files.
        Determine the count of files hashed in the file with hashes.
        Determine the count of unsuccessfully hashed directories.
        Have both counts output to the screen with an appropriate title for each count.

        find /bin /etc /var -maxdepth 3 ! -type p -exec md5sum {} \; 2>bad.txt 1>good.txt <--- maxdepth 3 no name pipes > STDOUT.del 2> STDERR.del use tac exec to md5sum the resulst in the container everything finds md5sum an sends to approaiate files
 
        good=$(wc -l good.txt | cut -d' ' -f1)
        bad=$(egrep "directory" bad.txt | wc -l | cut -d' ' -f1)
        echo "Successfully Hashed Files: $good"
        echo "Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories: $bad"
        
#### postional parameter:
  ```                                                
  #!/bin/bash
    2 #create a vraivble FILE assigning the value of arg1 (postional parameter 1)
    3 FILE=$1
    4 cat $FILE

  echo "rah marine corps" > file1
    284  echo "rah Navy bois" > file2
    285  cat file1
    286  cat file1 file2
    287  vim scripty.sh && chmod +x scripty.sh
    288  ./scripty.sh  file1
    289  ./scripty.sh  file2
  
  
  
    $0 	The name of the script
  $1 	The first argument to the script
  $2 	The second argument to the script
  $n 	The n-th argument to the script
  $# 	The number of arguments to the script
  $@ 	A list of all arguments to the script
  $* 	A list of all arguments to the script
  ${#N} 	The length of the value of positional parameter N (Korn shell only)
  ```
  
## DAY 4:

#### For Loops:
```
        the for loop iterates over a list of items and performs the gievn set of commands. The Bash for loop takes the following form: for itme in [LIST] do [COMMANDS] done.
        /Pseudo-Code
            for item in [LIST]
            do
            [COMMANDS]
            done
         The LIST can be a series of strings seperated by spaces a range of numbers. output of a command, an rray. and so on. All loops are great for automating repetive taks!
      ex.   
         #!/bin/bash
            for i in {1..10}
            do
                echo $i
            done
```            
#### Break & continue
```
        The break statement terminates the current loop and passes program control to the statement that follows the terminated statement. It is usually used to terminate the loop whne a certain condition is met.
            if [[ <condition> ]]; then
                break
            fi
        The continue statement exits the current iteration of a loop and passes program control to te next itertaion of the loop.
            if [[ <condition> ]]; then
                continue
            fi
            
 ```           
#### While and Untill loops:

    -The while loop is used to perform a given set of commands an unknown number of times as long as the given condition evaluates to true.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    counter=1
    while [[ $counter -le 10 ]]
    do
        echo $counter
        ((counter++))
    done
    echo "All done!"
    
    -The until loop is used to execute a given set of commands as long as the given condition evaluates to false.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    counter=1
    until [[ $counter -gt 10 ]]
    do
        echo $counter
        ((counter++))
   done
   echo "all done!"

### Activities 16-20:

##### q16:Design a script that detects the existence of directory: $HOME/.ssh

    Upon successful detection, copies any and all files from within the directory $HOME/.ssh to directory $HOME/SSH and produce no output. You will need to create $HOME/SSH.
    Upon un-successful detection, displays the error message "Run ssh-keygen" to the user.


```
DIR="$HOME/.ssh"  
        
#find $HOME/ -type d -iname ".ssh"
  
if [[ -d "$DIR" ]];then
         
    cp -r $HOME/.ssh $HOME/SSH
   
else
    echo "Run ssh-keygen "; exit 1 
fi

```
##### q17:
    Write a script that determines your default gateway ip address. Assign that address to a variable using command substitution.
        NOTE: Networking on the CTFd is limited for security reasons. ip route and route are emulated. Use either of those with no arguments/switches.
    Have your script determine the absolute path of the ping application. Assign the absolute path to a variable using command substitution. HINT: man which
    Have your script send six ping packets to your default gateway, utilizing the path discovered in the previous step, and assign the response to a variable using command substitution.
    Evaluate the response as being either successful or failure, and print an appropriate message to the screen.


```
IP=$(ip route | grep default | cut -d" " -f3)
   
PING=$(which ping)
  
SIX=$($PING -c6 $IP | grep "6 received" | cut -d" " -f 4-5)
if [[ $SIX == "6 received," ]];then
    echo "successful"
else
    echo "failure"
fi

OR

TEST=' 0%'
awk '/loss/{print$6}' <-- another way then egrep searches line for loss then print sixth field 
if [[ $SIX == $TEST ]];then
    echo success
else 
    echo failure 
 fi
```
#### q18.
    Create the following files in a new directory you create $HOME/ZIP:
        file1 will contain the md5sum of the text 12345
        file2 will contain the md5sum of the text 6789
        file3 will contain the md5sum of the text abcdef
    Create a zip file containing the three files above, without being stored inside a directory in the zip file. Name the zip file $HOME/ZIP/file.zip
        HINT: "Junk" the paths
    Utilize tar on $HOME/ZIP/file.zip to archive it into a file called $HOME/ZIP/file.tar.gz which should not include directories. Use the gzip option in tar, DO NOT use a seperate gzip binary.
        HINT: You might need an option to change directories first.
```
mkdir $HOME/ZIP/
   touch $HOME/ZIP/file{1,2,3}
   echo  '12345' | md5sum | cut -d" " -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file1
   echo  '6789' | md5sum | cut -d" " -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file2
   echo  'abcdef' | md5sum | cut -d" " -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file3
   
   zip --junk-path $HOME/ZIP/file.zip $HOME/ZIP/file{1..3} <--- just the files for junk path archives the three files in zip file 
   tar czf $HOME/ZIP/file.tar.gz -C $HOME/ZIP file.zip
```
#### q19.Utilize Bash looping to iteratively create each user account and their directories.

    Design a basic FOR Loop that iteratively alters the file system and user entries in a passwd-like file for new users: LARRY, CURLY, and MOE.
    Each user should have an entry in the $HOME/passwd file
    The userid and groupid will be the same and can be found as the sole contents of a file with the user's name in the $HOME directory (i.e. $HOME/LARRY.txt might contain 123)
    The home directory will be a directory with the user's name located under the $HOME directory (i.e. $HOME/LARRY)
        NOTE: Do NOT use shell expansion when specifying this in the $HOME/passwd file.
    The default shell will be /bin/bash
    The other fields in the new entries should match root's entry
    Users should be created in the order specified
    
    
```    
     1 #!/bin/bash
  2 FILE=$HOME/passwd
  3 rootline=$(egrep root $FILE)
  4 #for reference: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  5                # ?      ? ?      ?
  6 
  7 for NAME in LARRY CURLY MOE
  8 do
  9   ID= $(cat $HOME/${NAME}.txt)
 10   mkdir $HOME/$NAME
 11   echo $rootline | awk -F: -v nn=$NAME -v ii+$ID 'BEGIN{OFS=":"]{$1=nn;$3=$4=ii;$6="$HOME/"nn}{print $0}'
 12 done
 
```
#### q20.
    Write a bash script that will find all the files in the /etc directory, and obtains the octal permission of those files. The stat command will be useful for this task.
    Depending how you go about your script, you may find writing to the local directory useful. What you must seperate out from the initial results are the octal permissions of 0-640 and those equal to and greater than 642, ie 0-640 goes to low.txt, while 642 is sent to high.txt.
    Have your script uniquely sort the contents of the two files by count, numerically-reversed, and output the results, with applicable titles, to the screen. An example of the desired output is shown below.
        NOTE: There is a blank line being printed between the two sections of the output below.



#!/bin/bash
  2 #get octal perms nd write to intial.del for parsing.fu
  3 find /etc -printf '%m\n' 2>/dev/null > initial.del
  4 #Seperate high octals from the low ones
  5 for OCTAL in $(cat initial.del)
  6 do  
  7     if [[ $OCTAL -ge 642 ]];then
  8         echo "$OCTAL" >> high.del
  9     elif [[ $OCTAL -le 640 ]];then
 10         echo "$OCTAL" >> low.del
 11     fi  
 12 done
 13 
 14 # Achieve final output 
 15 echo "File w/ OCTAL Perm values 642+:"
 16 sort high.del | uniq -c | sort -nr
 17 echo
 18 echo "Files w/ OCTAL Perm Values 0-640:"
 19 sort low.del | uniq -c | sort -nr
 20 
 21 
 22 #cleans up
 23 rm *.del
